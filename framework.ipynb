    "We begin by loading all provided datasets and preparing a unified analytical dataset. This involves reading each CSV file into a pandas DataFrame and merging relevant information. Key tasks include parsing date fields, aligning timeframes (May 2024 – March 2025 for model training data), and integrating account attributes and macro/credit indicators:\n",
    "\n",
    " - Load Data: Read transaction files (transaction_fact and wrld_stor_tran_fact) and combine them. These contain individual credit card transactions. Also load account details (account_dim), fraud records (fraud_claim_case and fraud_claim_tran), credit usage snapshot (rams_batch_cur), monthly statements (statement_fact), and customer IDs (syf_id).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " - Parse Dates & Filter Range: Convert date columns to datetime objects and filter transactions to the timeframe May 2024 through March 2025 to focus on recent account behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " - Combine Transactions: Concatenate the two transaction fact tables (they have identical schemas) into one unified transactions DataFrame.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " - Join Account Info: Merge account attributes (like account open date, activation status, etc. from account_dim) onto the transaction data via the current_account_nbr key. This ensures each transaction can be linked to account-level info if needed (e.g., to exclude transactions before an account’s open date or to get account type).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " - Incorporate Credit & Macro Indicators: Use the rams_batch_cur data to bring in credit usage and macro-level indicators. The rams_batch_cur file provides each account’s credit line (cu_crd_line), behavior score (cu_bhv_scr), credit bureau score (cu_crd_bureau_scr), recent utilization rates (ca_avg_utilz_lst_3_mnths, etc.), and possibly macro-influenced scores. We join this to accounts on account number. (External macroeconomic data such as interest rates or consumer spending indices can optionally be merged here if available, using the mapping document to align any needed keys.)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " - Clean and Align Data: Handle missing values and data types (e.g., numeric fields such as transaction amounts, credit scores). We ensure that any inconsistent codes are handled (for example, some fields use placeholder values like 99 or #### for missing data – these are set to NaN or an appropriate value). The data from multiple sources is now consolidated per account and transaction, ready for analysis."

Using an ARIMA model allows us to extrapolate future spending based on past trends and seasonal effects. For example, many customers exhibit higher spending in holiday months (Nov-Dec) and lower in early-year months; ARIMA can capture such patterns in the time domain. \n",

    "For demonstration, we aggregate total portfolio spending by month and fit an ARIMA model to observe overall trends. In practice, we would apply ARIMA to each account’s time series (or to clusters of similar accounts) to get individual forecasts. The ARIMA( p,d,q ) parameters can be chosen via evaluation of ACF/PACF or automated selection (e.g., using pmdarima.auto_arima). Seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA) may be considered if strong seasonal periodicity is observed (here, yearly seasonality of holiday spending)."

We label each account as risk=1 (bad) if it has known issues: fraud case, went to collections, or severe delinquency/over-limit behavior; otherwise risk=0 (good). Given our data, the positive class is rare (~0.4% of accounts had fraud, and none showed collections in the timeframe, though some had delinquencies). This will be an imbalanced classification problem, so we may use techniques like class weighting or oversampling for model training to ensure the model can detect the minority class. We experiment with Logistic Regression to predict risk. The model is trained on historical data (e.g., using features from before Q1 2025 to predict which accounts ended up as risky by Q1 2025) and then applied to all accounts to predict their risk going forward."
